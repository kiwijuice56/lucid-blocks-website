						</li>
						<img class="embedded-image" src="images/fusion_example.webp" alt="How to fuse items together in Lucid Blocks"/>

						</li>

						</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>where can i play?</h4>
					<p>
						lucid blocks is coming soon on the Steam store. release is planned for Windows devices, but Android/Linux/Mac may
						be supported in the future. in the meantime, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZpHcNc50K-yK7tfmONFV6WC_Xxd8dsRFvHRwL_qLhiYKQ6g/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=110465931425033726348">
							sign up for beta playtesting</a> and join the discord server to meet the community.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>is it multiplayer?</h4>
					<p>unfortunately, no. multiplayer is not planned for release or future updates. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>do i need a good computer?</h4>
					<p>
						no! lucid blocks is optimized to work on all ranges of devices, so you don't have to worry about
						a powerful GPU or gaming setup to play.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>will this be translated into other languages?</h4>
					<p>
						no translations are currently in development, but i hope to translate to at least Russian and Portuguese
						if the community is large enough! thankfully, there is not much text in the game.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>is this a mod of another game?</h4>
					<p>
						no, lucid blocks was developed from scratch. it is not a modification or variation of any existing games.
						all assets within the game (including artwork, models, sounds, and music) were created by the developer or repurposed
						from assets with open source and creative commons licenses.
					</p>
				</li>

			</ul>

			<h3> development </h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>who is this made by?</h4>
					<p>lucid blocks has one developer, <a href="https://ericalfaro.dev">Eric Alfaro</a>.
						i am a 20 year old computer science student developing this game in my free time.
						i enjoy anything related to programming, graphics, and art! i also like to cook and make music.
					    my hope is to make games forever, but i also plan to be a researcher in the future.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>how was this made?</h4>
					<p>
						lucid blocks was created in the Godot game engine using <nobr>C++</nobr> and GDscript.
						it started as a simple voxel engine to test Godot's capabilities, but evolved
						into its own project over the past year. many of the sprites are photos of junk from around
						my house or a dollar store!
						the art was made using Aseprite and the music was composed in FL Studio.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>can we work together?</h4>
					<p>i greatly appreciate anyone that reaches out, but i will have to decline for the sake of keeping the
						project within a reasonable scope. i would still love to hear your ideas in the discord server,
						many player suggestions have been added to the game already!
					</p>
